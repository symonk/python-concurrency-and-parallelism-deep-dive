"""
Core daemon thread notes are outlined below:

  Every thread you create can be flagged as a 'daemon' thread.  The significance of this flag is that the entire
  python program will exit when only daemon threads are left alive.
  
  You can actually call .join() on a daemon thread as outlined below; but it is not really advised.  Most instances you 
  are doing this, chances are you want a non daemon thread.
  
  Typically any well designed daemon thread is designed to run as long as the program runs and calling .join() on it
  would imply (if it is well designed) that it would block until the daemon thread ends (which in this instance is likely
  never)
  
  Thread objects only check that the daemon= flag is not None, and None is the default behaviour.
  
  Threading daemon state is inherited from the starting thread, so starting another thread on a daemon thread will
  automatically create another daemon thread.
  
  All threads created (with default behaviour) from the main thread are ofcourse non daemon threads
  
  Java style accessors exist such as setDaemon() and isDaemon() but you will likely never be using those!
